![Project Logo/Introduction Image](path/to/your/image.png) <!-- Replace with an appropriate image -->

### Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for a deepfake authenticity verification framework using machine learning techniques. The framework aims to detect and classify deepfake videos/images from real ones.

### Dataset
You can download the dataset used in this project from [Kaggle - Deepfake and Real Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images).

### Source Code
The source code for this project is also available on Kaggle. View the notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/haritmengar/deepfake-authenticity-verification-framework-in-ml).

### Features
- **Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques for preparing images/videos.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM) for classification.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and methods used to evaluate model performance.
- **Deployment:** Instructions for deploying the model or using it in other applications.
